When working with databases please make sure to consult schemas.md to ensure that we make the appropriate insertions and general interactions with the database.

When working with external scripts and APIs such as those we have on bunny.net, please reference scripts.md to make sure you're calling the right endpoints and urls.

When generating CSS please make sure to first reference forms.css and try to either use the styling already in there or to generate subcomponents of the classes contained there.
