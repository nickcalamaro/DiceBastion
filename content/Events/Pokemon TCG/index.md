Join us for our first ever Pokemon TCG Showdown, sponsored by Vijay and with help from our friends at PB CardShack!

At this event you'll have the chance to play against other trainers and compete for some great prizes, including your very own Journey Together Elite Trainer Box! 

The event will be played in the standard format (using cards from the Sword & Shield Series onwards) If you'd like some help building a deck or to get some practice games in, you can come down to our club next to Dominos on any Friday from 6pm. You can also join our WhatsApp community where our welcoming community will be more than happy to help you build your first deck or give you some practice.
