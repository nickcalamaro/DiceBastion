# History

The **Gibraltar Warhammer Club** was formed in 2016 by local Warhammer players looking for a shared space to play some games and grow the scene in Gibraltar. Over the years the Gibraltar Warhammer has continued to grow, welcoming local players from around the Campo de Gibraltar and beyond. We host regular tournaments, an annual league Warhammer 40,000 league and have represented Gibraltar in the Warhammer World Championships.

Our venue offers award-winning Warhammer terrain, gaming tables, a board game library, comfortable seating and a safe welcoming community for players to meet, compete, and enjoy a wide variety of games.

We run regular events, shared through WhatsApp and our social media, and welcome the public every week.

Members receive exclusive benefits, including local discounts and free access to the venue. Your membership helps keep the club running by covering bills, improving the space with new furniture and games, and supporting the events we host.
