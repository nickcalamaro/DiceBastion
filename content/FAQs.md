# INTRODUCING: Dice Bastion Gibraltar

We’re proud to announce that after a couple of years of hosting board game, card game and RPG events, a few of us have decided to set up a new brand as a branch of the GWC family!

Dice Bastion will keep hosting these events while giving us the chance to make game related content like board game reviews and tournament reports. We also hope this will help us reach out to the wider gaming community in Gibraltar who aren’t necessarily familiar with Warhammer, which will help us keep raising funds and improving the club for all players!



# FAQs

## Why have you set this up?

After running board game, card game and RPG events at the club for a couple of years, we've noticed the name has turned away some people who are unfamiliar with warhammer. We also wanted to give ourselves a brand to help create more content and run more events for board games, card games, and RPGs, the same way that SN Battle Reports has found so much success with Warhammer and particularly Horus Heresy Content.


## What does this mean for the Gibraltar Warhammer Club?

Nothing is changing for the GWC. The club will still have the same name as it always has and will still be managed by the committee on behalf of the members who elect them each year in January. The location will still be called ‘Gibraltar Warhammer Club.’

Setting up Dice Bastion just means that when we run non-warhammer events as we have been doing, we will be going by a different name for a clearer distinction. This also means our Warhammer players will have an easier time finding Warhammer-specific events and information, without being overwhelmed by unrelated game types.

## Do you still plan to host Warhammer Events?
Yes! SN Battle Reports and will be running the annual 40k league. We'd also like to get back to running Age of Sigmar or Old World events, so if anyone wants to volunteer to help organise those, please get in touch! We hadn’t run these lately because there hasn't been as much interest but we’d love to help make it happen! We'll also be having our annual Christmas Apocalypse game and are open to any other suggestions/requests that our members may have!

## Is my membership still valid? 
Yes, your membership will still give you the same benefits as always. It will also continue to give you discounts for all events run by Dice Bastion, SN Battle Reports, and any other eligible events organised by the Gibraltar Warhammer Club.
