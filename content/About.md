Founded in 2016 as the Gibraltar Warhammer Club, this is Gibraltar’s home for board games, card games, RPGs, and wargames. Our venue offers a board game library, comfortable seating, and gaming tables, providing a space for players to meet, compete, and enjoy a wide variety of games.

We run regular events, shared through our WhatsApp channels and social media, and welcome the public every Friday. Members receive exclusive benefits, including local discounts and free access to the venue.

Your membership helps keep the club running by covering rent and bills, improving the space with new furniture and games, and supporting the events we host.

Find us in the vaults above Domino’s Pizza at Landport Tunnel – we look forward to seeing you!
